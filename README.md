# remote-wrap

Proof-of-concept utility to execute encrypted remote files without touching the filesystem.

Encryption is done using `openssl`'s `EVP` API with 256-bit AES.
Files are downloaded from a remote server using `libCURL` from an specified URL.
`memfd_create()` is used to create in-memory temporary files to store downloaded executables, leaving no filesystem trace.
Then `exec()` is called on the file descriptor path to run them.

An encryption program has been included to create encrypted executables.

To try it out first make sure that both `openssl` and `libCURL` are available.
Use `scripts/test_sample.sh` to easily spin up a python http server and execute a provided sample program.
`scripts/gen_sample.sh` may be used to recompile and reencrypt the sample program.

To use the program directly, use

```bash
make RUNFLAGS="IN OUT" MAIN_USED=encrypt run
```

to encrypt a program, and:

```bash
make RUNFLAGS="URL" run
```

to run it, assuming that the file can be access using `URL`.
